# Sparse-UBI-S3-V2
A new method for identifying the mixing matrix in underdetermined BSS based on k-SCA
Assume X=A.S,

Prblem statement: X is known but A and S are unknown.
The columns of S are k-Sparse, nemely, there are k non-zero elemnets. 
Aim: Find the mixing matrix A

Idea: Subspace Selective Search (S3)
