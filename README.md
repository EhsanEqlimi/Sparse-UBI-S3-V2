# Sparse-UBI-S3-V2
A new method for identifying the mixing matrix in underdetermined blind source seperation (UBSS) based on k-sparse component analysis (k-SCA)

Assume X=A.S,

Prblem statement: X is known but A and S are unknown. There are more sources than sensors. 

The columns of S are k-Sparse, nemely, there are k non-zero elemnets. 

Aim: Find the mixing matrix A

Idea: Subspace Selective Search (S3)
